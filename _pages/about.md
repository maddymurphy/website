I am pursuing a PhD in Chemical Engineering at Caltech starting Fall 2024, as a NSF Graduate Research Fellow. In Spring 2024, I completed my undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering, graduating summa cum laude with highest distinction, with minors in both Mathematics and Chemistry. 

I have completed two years of research under the andvisory of Prof. Paul Dauenhauer on a project funded by the Center for Programmable Energy Catalysis. The research focuses on simualtion of a loop reaction on a dynamic catalyst surface, exploring the parameter space to develop an understanding of how catalyst perturbation can induce net flow of molecules about the reactive loop. 

As I begin graduate school, my research interests include computational catalysis, electrocatalysis, and machine learning. I intend to pursue research on machine learning methods to help deepen the understanding of electrocatalyst design and increase the efficiency of the search for novel electrocataylsts for application in energy-related electrocatalytic conversion of small molecules. 

Prior to my undergraduate studies in Minnesota, I grew up in Lakewood, CO.
